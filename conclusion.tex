In the analysis of CE profiles, band annotation has remained the most time-consuming and error-prone step, due to the lack of robust computational tools for automating the process. Using a dynamic-programming approach, the proposed algorithm can find an optimal arrangement of bands in a given CE profile, under a scoring scheme suitable for high-throughput CE experiments with multiple profiles. On over 100 CE data sets including designed and biological RNAs, the proposed method identified the band positions matching the reference positions with acccuracy sufficiently high as to obviate or significantly reduce manual correction. Finally, the quality of the band positions are well predicted by $\escore$-score, flagging unreliable annotations to the user.
