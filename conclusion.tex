In the analysis of CE profiles, band annotation has remained the most time-consuming step, due to the lack of robust computational tools for automating the process. Using a dynamic-programming approach, the proposed algorithm can find an optimal arrangements of bands in a given CE profile, under a scoring scheme suitable for high-throughput CE experiments with multiple profiles. Based on our tests with nearly 100 CE data sets, the proposed method identified the band positions matching the reference positions closely. In addition, the quality of the band positions were well predicted by $\escore$-score.
