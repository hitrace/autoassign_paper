The left figure illustrates five profiles (SHAPE, DMS, CMCT, nomod, ddTTP) of CE data and an example of their band annotation. Each band location is directed by red line from the corresponding row (nucleotide) of the prediction matrix on the right side. Basically the objective of band annotation is to determine band locations such that the ones in the prediction matrix correspond to high intensity values, and zeros to low values. It is also important to keep the locations fairly evenly distributed on the entire profile, as in this figure. }}}{1}}

MSE units are normalized so that average distance between band locations is unity. The mean and median MSE for the proposed method (mean: 0.839, median: 0.198) are clearly lower than those for the others: no knowledge on secondary structures (mean:0.879, median:0.355), no short G bonus (mean:0.905, median:0.205), the proposed method carried out on individual profiles separately (mean:0.973, median:0.257), the method without explicit peak-matching (mean:1.274, median:0.328).}}}{1}}
